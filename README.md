# üè¶ Lending Club Loan Default Prediction

A comprehensive machine learning project to predict loan defaults using the Lending Club dataset and optimized threshold based on target Bad-rate(10%), with end-to-end model development, explainability, and interactive dashboard deployment.

**Bad rate**: The proportion of loans that have become defaulted, indicating the percentage of loans that are unlikely to be fully repaid.

## üìñ Project Overview

This project tackles the challenge of predicting loan defaults in peer-to-peer lending. Rather than just building a model, I focused on creating a complete, production-ready system that includes:

- **Thorough Exploratory Data Analysis** to understand lending patterns
- **Advanced Feature Engineering** with interaction terms and domain knowledge
- **Model Optimization** using Optuna for hyperparameter tuning  
- **Business-Aligned Thresholding** based on bad rate control (not just accuracy)
- **Model Explainability** with SHAP for transparent decisions
- **Interactive Dashboard** for real-time loan assessment

## üéØ Key Results

- **ROC AUC**: 0.74+ (competitive performance for credit risk)
- **Recall**: 76% (successfully identifies 3 out of 4 defaults)
- **Business Threshold**: Optimized for 10% bad rate with 49% approval rate
- **Explainable**: Every prediction comes with clear reasoning

## üìä Dataset

Using the **Lending Club Dataset** (2007-2018), publicly available and widely used for credit risk modeling:
- 2.2M+ loan records with 150+ features
- Comprehensive borrower information, credit history, and loan terms
- Focus on completed loans only (Fully Paid vs Charged Off/Default)

## üîç Key Visualizations & Insights

Here are some key findings from the analysis:

### Income Verification Paradox
![Income Verification vs Default](images/inc_ver_vs_default.png)

Surprisingly, borrowers with verified income default more often - this reveals that verification is targeted toward riskier applicants, not random.

### Geographic Risk Patterns  
![State vs Default Rates](images/state_vs_default.png)

Clear geographic patterns emerge, with Mississippi (26% default rate) vs DC (13% default rate) showing stark differences.

### Loan Characteristics Impact

![DTI vs Default](images/dti_vs_default.png)
![Term vs Default](images/term_vs_default.png)

- Higher loan grades dramatically increase default risk
- Debt-to-income ratio shows clear risk escalation  
- 60-month terms double the default rate vs 36-month terms

## üèÜ Business Impact

This isn't just a data science exercise - it's designed for real-world deployment:

- **Risk-based approval** with configurable bad rate targets
- **Transparent decisions** meeting regulatory requirements  
- **Interactive dashboard** for loan officers and executives
- **Scalable pipeline** for batch and real-time scoring

## üìä Key Features of the Dashboard

The Streamlit dashboard provides:

- **Loan Application Input Form**: Enter borrower details and loan characteristics
- **Real-time Risk Assessment**: Instant default probability calculation
- **SHAP Explanations**: Visual breakdown of decision factors
- **Business Metrics**: Approval rates and expected bad rates
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore model behavior across different scenarios

## üîç Model Performance Details

### Classification Metrics
- **Precision**: 0.23 (of predicted defaults, 23% are actual defaults)
- **Recall**: 0.76 (captures 76% of all actual defaults)
- **F1-Score**: 0.35 (balanced harmonic mean)
- **ROC AUC**: 0.73 (strong discrimination ability)

### Business Metrics
- **Bad Rate at 10% threshold**: Maintains target risk levels
- **Approval Rate**: 50% of applications approved
- **Expected Risk**: Quantified financial risk assessment

## üö® Important Notes

- **Model Limitations**: This model is trained on historical data (2007-2018) and may not reflect current economic conditions
- **Ethical Considerations**: Ensure fair lending practices and avoid discriminatory features
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Model explanations support regulatory requirements but legal review is recommended
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring required for production deployment
